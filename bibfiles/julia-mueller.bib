abstract = {BACKGROUND The Web has become an important information source for appraising symptoms. We need to understand the role it currently plays in help seeking and symptom evaluation to leverage its potential to support health care delivery. OBJECTIVE The aim was to systematically review the literature currently available on Web use for symptom appraisal. METHODS We searched PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, ACM Digital Library, SCOPUS, and Web of Science for any empirical studies that addressed the use of the Web by lay people to evaluate symptoms for physical conditions. Articles were excluded if they did not meet minimum quality criteria. Study findings were synthesized using a thematic approach. RESULTS A total of 32 studies were included. Study designs included cross-sectional surveys, qualitative studies, experimental studies, and studies involving website/search engine usage data. Approximately 35{\%} of adults engage in Web use for symptom appraisal, but this proportion varies between 23{\%} and 75{\%} depending on sociodemographic and disease-related factors. Most searches were symptom-based rather than condition-based. Users viewed only the top search results and interacted more with results that mentioned serious conditions. Web use for symptom appraisal appears to impact on the decision to present to health services, communication with health professionals, and anxiety. CONCLUSIONS Web use for symptom appraisal has the potential to influence the timing of help seeking for symptoms and the communication between patients and health care professionals during consultations. However, studies lack suitable comparison groups as well as follow-up of participants over time to determine whether Web use results in health care utilization and diagnosis. Future research should involve longitudinal follow-up so that we can weigh the benefits of Web use for symptom appraisal (eg, reductions in delays to diagnosis) against the disadvantages (eg, unnecessary anxiety and health care use) and relate these to health care costs.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Delays to diagnosis in lung cancer can lead to reduced chance of survival, and patients often wait for several months before presenting symptoms. The time between first symptom recognition until diagnosis has been theorized into three intervals: symptom appraisal, help-seeking, and diagnostic interval (here: "pathway to diagnosis"). Interventions are needed to reduce delays to diagnosis in lung cancer. The Web has become an important lay health information source and could potentially play a role in this pathway to diagnosis. OBJECTIVE Our overall aim was to gain a preliminary insight into whether Web-based information plays a role in the pathway to diagnosis in lung cancer in order to assess whether it may be possible to leverage this information source to reduce delays to diagnosis. METHODS Patients diagnosed with lung cancer in the 6 months before study entry completed a survey about whether (and how, if yes) they had used the Web to appraise their condition prior to diagnosis. Based on survey responses, we purposively sampled patients and their next-of-kin for semistructured interviews (24 interviews; 33 participants). Interview data were analyzed qualitatively using Framework Analysis in the context of the pathway to diagnosis model. RESULTS A total of 113 patients completed the survey (age: mean 67.0, SD 8.8 years). In all, 20.4{\%} (23/113) reported they or next-of-kin had researched their condition online before the diagnosis. The majority of searches (20/23, 87.0{\%}) were conducted by or with the help of next-of-kin. Interview results suggest that patients and next-of-kin perceived an impact of the information found online on all three intervals in the time to diagnosis. In the appraisal interval, participants used online information to evaluate symptoms and possible causes. In the help-seeking interval, the Web was used to inform the decision of whether to present to health services. In the diagnostic interval, it was used to evaluate health care professionals' advice, to support requests for further investigation of symptoms, and to understand medical jargon. Within this interval, we identified two distinct subintervals (before/after relevant diagnostic tests were initiated), in which the Web reportedly played different roles. CONCLUSIONS Because only 20.4{\%} of the sample reported prediagnosis Web searches, it seems the role of the Web before diagnosis of lung cancer is at present still limited, but this proportion is likely to increase in the future, when barriers such as unfamiliarity with technology and unwillingness to be informed about one's own health are likely to decrease. Participants' perceptions suggest that the Web can have an impact on all three intervals in the pathway to diagnosis. Thus, the Web may hold the potential to reduce delays in the diagnostic process, and this should be explored in future research and interventions. Our results also suggest a division of the diagnostic interval into two subintervals may be useful.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES To detail the development method used to produce an online, tailored, theory-based, user-centred intervention to encourage help-seeking for potential lung cancer symptoms. DESIGN Intervention development was structured around the person-based approach. The feasibility study involved a randomized controlled trial design. METHODS Intervention development drew on qualitative inquiries, the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB), and identifying concrete mechanisms of change to implement in the intervention (Behaviour Change Techniques). The final intervention involved two key features: (1) tailoring and (2) 'TPB components' to target beliefs about help-seeking. In an online feasibility study, we recruited people reporting potential lung cancer symptoms using mailing lists, social media, websites, and Google AdWords. Participants were randomized to the intervention, a tailored comparison group (CG) without TPB-components, an untailored CG with TPB components, or a CG with neither. Following treatment, participants clicked a button to indicate whether they wished to make an appointment and completed a TPB questionnaire. RESULTS A total of 130 participants reporting relevant symptoms were recruited (24{\%} of website visitors). Participants in the intervention group reported higher intention to seek help than those who received tailored information without TPB components (p = .03). User comments indicate more support is needed for people who sought help for symptoms, but felt dismissed. CONCLUSIONS The potential for differential dropout in online randomized trials requires careful consideration. Future help-seeking interventions should provide support for those who have previously felt dismissed by health professionals. The feasibility study provides some evidence that our 'TPB components' were effective, but validation in a powered trial is necessary. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? People with lung cancer often delay presenting symptoms to health services. Some patients (or their family/friends) look up symptoms online before their diagnosis, to decide whether they should see a doctor. Interventions are needed to ensure people can find useful information online that will encourage them to seek help for relevant symptoms. What does this study add? Theory-mapping and user involvement facilitated systematic intervention development. Lung cancer help-seeking interventions should address salient beliefs and personal relevance. The potential for differential dropout in online randomized trials requires careful consideration.},
