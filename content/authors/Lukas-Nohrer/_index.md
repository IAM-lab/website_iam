My research investigates the role and application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in a cultural environment. I am mainly interested in the use of machine learning - such as recommender systems and unsupervised learning - as a curatorial tool and as a means to analyse and explore museum collections. These collections are rich, heterogenous (multimodal) datasets holding the knowledge and assets of our societyâ€™s memory institutions. Working with my partner institutions (the Smithsonian, the National Gallery London, Manchester Art Gallery and the Whitworth) enables me to explore the role of ML in museums from a computational, and also from a societal/social perspective.
