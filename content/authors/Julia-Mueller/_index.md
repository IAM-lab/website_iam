I completed a Bsc in Psychology (distinction) at the Georg-August-University in Goettingen, Germany in October 2011, and an MSc in Health Psychology (distinction) at the University of St Andrews in September 2013. My studies got me interested in the links between psychological and physical well-being, and in the potential of Web-based interventions for improving health.
 
In 2013, I commenced a PhD research project at the University of Manchester about the role of Web-based information in help-seeking of those worried about lung cancer. This interdisciplinary project was supervised by Professor Chris Todd (Psychology/Nursing) and Professor Simon Harper & Dr Caroline Jay (Computer Science). I was awarded funding by the Medical Research Council and by a President's Doctoral Scholar Award, the University of Manchester's flagship funding scheme for the top 3% of research students who demonstrate academic excellence and leadership potential. My PhD was awarded in February 2018 with no corrections by viva examiners Professor Stephen Sutton (University of Cambridge) and Professor Janelle York (University of Manchester).
 
Alongside my PhD I worked as a project assistant in the Division of Population Health, Health Services Research & Primary Care, and as a Teaching Assistant at the School of Psychological Sciences.
 
After my PhD I worked as a Research Associate in the Division of Population Health, Health Services Research & Primary Care, and in the School of Computer Science, working on an mHealth project on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Since July 2018, I have been a lecturer in healthcare sciences, as part of the i3HS Hub (a multidisciplinary project to promote teaching and research for population health benefit through data sciences). I lead a course unit on Digital Public Health, and also teach on several course units on epidemiology.
