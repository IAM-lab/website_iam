My research involves engineering Conversational Agents to improve understanding in an automotive environment. I used to work as a Data Scientist for 2Excel geo, where I was challenged with Computer Vision applications with handling hyper-spectral images. Before that, I was working as a research assistant at Lancaster University for tracking malicious flows in a Software Defined Network, and this is where I completed my MSc in Data Science where I had an internship with Boots.
