# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio:  Iâ€™m interested in development of fast algorithms to extract information and meaning from large complex networks. My PhD work is focused on social networks, understanding how they are structured and how information flows within them, applied specifically to users discussing vaccination.

My work in complex networks prior to the start of my PhD studies encompassed two main topics:

- Generation of random networks: I worked on a random network model that could be used as a generator for an ensemble of random networks. This ensemble can be used, for example, to find network motifs, encompassing more structural information about the network than the original model.
- Efficient estimation of subgraph frequencies: I worked on a novel, adaptive, algorithm to accurately estimate the frequencies of small subgraphs within very large networks.

Both these topics were supervised by [Pedro Ribeiro](http://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/~pribeiro/), from the Computer Science Department at the University of Porto. Since the start of my PhD, I have also started working on network comparison, especially applied to directed networks, and node centrality measures. These two topics are mainly being applied to social networks, like Twitter, but the methodology is applicable to networks from other domains. My supervisors for my PhD work are [Caroline Jay](https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/caroline.jay.html) and [Thomas House](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/thomas.house/about.html).
