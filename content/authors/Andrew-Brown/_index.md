While working as a Post-Doctoral Researcher with IAM, I collaborated with [BBC Research and Development](https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd), exploring how TV audiences split their attention between the television and other devices. I now work at BBC R&D as a Research Scientist (and part-time Software Engineer), exploring novel audience-facing experiences and how they can be built. More information about me can be found at my [BBC R&D profile](https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/people/andy-brown)
