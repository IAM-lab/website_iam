Sarah Clinch is a Lecturer in Pervasive Computing in the School of Computer Science. Her research sits at the intersection of pervasive computing and HCI, and is often focused on data-centric applications in domains such as: lifelogging, human memory augmentation, digital cognition, mental health, and pervasive display personalisation. She conducts systems and user research, using a variety of quantitative and qualitative methods — she’s particularly interested in the development and study of technologies in long-term, real-world deployment. 

Dr. Clinch has a PhD from Lancaster University (2014). She sits on the editorial board of IEEE Pervasive Computing and the Proceedings of the ACM on Interactive, Mobile, Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies (IMWUT). Clinch is an inaugural member of the ACM Future of Computing Academy.

Clinch is passionate about interdisciplinary research, working with psychologists, sociologists and designers. She welcomes students from all backgrounds — her current students include those with a first degree Computer Science, and those from other disciplines (e.g. Psychology). She’s always keen to hear from enthusiastic and talented prospective Ph.D. students or post-docs wishing to conduct their research in relevant topics.
