Aitor has a PhD with three years of subsequent experience as a research associate at the University of Manchester. Aitorâ€™s main focus during his PhD was on Web interaction analysis, building scalable tools to process, analyse, and derive insights from millions of low-level Web interaction events captured from thousands of users.

After his PhD Aitor joined the University of Manchester as a research associate, taking part in projects that involve extensive data analysis, design and implementation of analysis tools, and evaluation of user interfaces. One such tool is WevQuery, an interactive Web application that provides users with easy access to interaction data through the creation of event-based queries.

Aitor is currently a Research Software Engineer, where he provides his experience as a researcher and full-stack software developer, combining Web applications with data science features.
