After obtaining a bachelor's degree in science and technology of electronic information from Univesity of  Electronic Science and Technology of China in 2015, I become a master student in Computer Science at the University of Manchester. Continuing my interest in the final project of my master's degree, I am a PhD student exploring symptom knowledge in Parkinson's Disease.

My PhD project is inspired by previous knowledge that multiple symptoms of Parkinson's Disease (PD) can cause social withdrawal, so social withdrawal could be an overall indicator of  PD progression. Building on initial work carried out by our lab, my project will use smartphones to monitor social withdrawal in terms of PD progression regularly. The predictive model to be built on smartphone data will enable a better-individualised measurement of PD progression. We hypothesise that this will be more effective than standard methods.
