bio:  My main research area is Eye Tracking on the Web. I am interested in analysing eye movements of users to understand how they interact with web pages to make the web more accessible in constrained environments. Besides this, I have recently started to work on Learning Analytics & Software Engineering. I am interested in empirical analyses of learning challenges in Software Engineering.

I am currently working as a Research Associate in Software Engineering and Education in the Institute of Coding at the University of Manchester.

I completed my BSc in Information Systems Engineering at Cyprus International University in 2009 as the first ranked graduate. After that, I received my MSc in Information Technology (Data Engineering) at the University of Wolverhampton in 2011. I then completed my PhD in Computer Science at the University of Manchester in 2016 with the Outstanding PhD Thesis Prize under the supervision of Dr. Simon Harper and Dr. Yeliz Yesilada. After my PhD, I worked as a post-doctoral researcher in the Interaction Analysis and Modelling Lab at Middle East Technical University Northern Cyprus Campus (METU NCC).

My main research area is Eye Tracking on the Web. I am interested in analysing eye movements of users to understand how they interact with web pages to make the web more accessible in constrained environments. Besides this, I have recently started to work on Learning Analytics & Software Engineering. I am interested in empirical analyses of learning challenges in Software Engineering.
