Mobile applications often promote healthier living, but can also become a source of obsessive negative behaviour, particularly for young people living in an age of ‘fitspo’ (fitness inspiration) perpetuated by social media. Furthermore, many applications are designed to promote continuous engagement, potentially fostering compulsive behaviours.

In this project, we explore the role of mobile interactions in undesirable mental health behaviours across the domains of eating disorder (including excessive exercise), self harm and binge drinking. We consider the degree to which technologies themselves can be used to detect and intervene in harmful behaviours. We also seek to identify strategies and approaches for technology design that can mitigate potential risk.
