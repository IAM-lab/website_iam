This project is part of the five-year research [partnership](https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/projects/data-science-research-partnership) with eight UK Universities, including Manchester, to unlock the potential of data in media. More generally, the research partnership is at the forefront of machine learning in the media industry, helping create a more personal BBC that can inform, educate and entertain in new ways.

While the research partnership is focusing on create a wide ranging body research, this specific project focuses on two points:

  1. Understanding audiences (primarily): use data to better understand what audiences want from the BBC, why they want it, and what impact these programmes or services have on them.
  2. Curation and personalisation (secondary): create a more personal BBC, designing tools and algorithms to help programme makes with editorial and commissioning decisions.
