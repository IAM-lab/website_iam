We in a world in which our ability to capture personal user data far exceeds our understanding of how to manage issues of trust, privacy and consent, with potentially far-reaching consequences for both individuals and society. In this project we conduct pioneering interdisciplinary research to create the world's first comprehensive system for privacy and consent management in future pervasive environments, i.e. environments with a wide range of sensing capabilities. The project work is motivated by, and grounded in, three scenarios - future healthcare, human memory augmentation and personalised information presentation. These applications have the potential to transform key areas of our society yet raise significant privacy and consent issues that are likely to inhibit their deployment.

Questions this project explores include:

- Is delegation a viable option for consent decision-making?
- How do we manage the tension that arise when seeking to deliver personalised content in public settings?
- What is the role of personal devices when accessing data in future healthcare settings?
- What vulnerabilities in our thinking may be important when designing trustworthy systems?
- How can cloudlets or edge-of-cloud systems be leveraged to preserve user privacy in data-centric pervasive computing systems?
