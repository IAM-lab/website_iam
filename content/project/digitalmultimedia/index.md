Advances in technology have led to digital multimedia becoming a staple of everyday life in society. However, as technology becomes more integrated into daily activities, this may have consequences for cognitive processes such as memory. Sparrow, Liu, and Wegner (2011) found that people find it easier to recall where to find information online than the information itself, and thus propose that the internet is being used as external memory storage space. Furthermore, a review by Wilmer, Sherman, and Chein (2017) suggests cognitive domains beyond memory may be degraded by digital multimedia, for example attention or emotional regulation.

However, digital technologies have been found to improve memory in some cases. Mikusz, Clinch, Shaw, Davies and Nurmi, (2018) found that screens around university campuses could be utilised to display memory cues to aid students. This shows that the integration of technology into society can be used to aid memory as well as cause cognitive degradation.

There is a lack of consensus in the research over how technology can affect memory and at present little research offers an explanation as to why memory degradation takes place, and how this interacts with different forms of digital multimedia. As children of younger ages are using technology, there is a further gap in the research regarding the long-term effects of using technology on memory.
