As a species we have a long history of developing tools and techniques to augment our natural capacity for memory (e.g. storytelling, written language, photographs). Innovation in digital technology and multimedia has transformed this process, providing new innovative means by which we can record experiences, knowledge, plans and procedures.

Despite some clear cognitive benefits, the popular press and others have raised concerns about the potential negative impacts of technology on cognition (e.g. Carr, 2008). Research in this domain is limited, but a small number of studies have identified potential inhibitive effects of technology on memory. Most noteably, Sparrow, Liu, and Wegner (2011) found that people find it easier to recall where to find information online than the information itself, and thus propose that the internet is being used as external memory storage space. Furthermore, a review by Wilmer, Sherman, and Chein (2017) suggests cognitive domains beyond memory may be degraded by digital multimedia, for example attention or emotional regulation. 

In this interdisciplinary project we seek to develop understanding of how technology is changing the way that humans remember, with the intention of helping to guide the development of future information systems. This is an ongoing project to which new PhD research applications are welcome. Current areas of focus include:

- Perceptions and stereotypes humans maintain about their technology devices and the impact these have on cognition.
- The role of Q&A websites on the memory of software engineers and those learning to program
- Representation of memories in social media content.
