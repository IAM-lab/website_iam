Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is an incurable long-term neurological disease with an unknown cause. It affects one percent of the population of people over sixty. PD patients usually spent more time reside in their homes and have fewer social interactions. So social withdrawal is one of the potential symptoms caused by PD. Social wellbeing has been shown to be essential to the quality of life of PD patients. But little is known about how the progression of PD influence social life of patients. In addition, social withdrawal can be influenced by many factors. And there is also no widely used social withdrawal measurement, especially for PD.

Inspired from the similar study of Alzheimer disease, we give the working definition of social withdrawal as the reduction of social interaction associated with PD. And from the symptoms of PD, we hypothesise that, with the progression, people with PD will reduce the social interaction by choosing people they are more familiar with (families rather than strangers) and channels require fewer functions (calls rather than face-to-face). Smartphones are the now widely used and the hub of communications. With advanced sensors embedded, they can detect heterogeneous data of behaviour of users including their social activities unobtrusively and continuously. Comprehensive social interaction data including on the phone and off the phone will be captured to inference the extent of social withdrawal of PD patients in this project.
